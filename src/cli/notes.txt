Ideal project structure:
projects/ or playground/
    <project_name>/
        data/
            raw/            <- original data dump, after import ignore 
            interim/        <- data space for cleaning
            processed/      <- final data
            external/       <- metadata
            db/             <- database folder of tables in raw
        docs/
            assets/         <- image storage for README.md
            sources.txt     <- url references
        reports/            <- dashboards
        notebooks/
            <project_name>.ipynb    <- general notebook
        README.md                   <- for github

NB: <project_name> and <project_name>.ipynb have the same project name


General notes:
Want to change dir:

base_dir/
    .git
    projects/
    playground/
    src/

to

data-portfolio/
    .git
    projects/
        main/
        playground/

base_dir/
    .git
    src/

since a project in playground/ is called a project despite not being in project/

Want to move project/ to another base_dir
For this project, allow data projects to exist inside base_dir
